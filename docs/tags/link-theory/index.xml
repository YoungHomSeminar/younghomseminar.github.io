      <description>Recently I gave a talk about the homotopy groups of spheres, and as usual, I try to collect my thoughts on this blog before (or after) presenting. The homotopy groups of spheres have featured several times on this blog, and we have made some effort into calculating them for some small dimensions. In the talk I wanted to showcase some methods used to calculate these groups, as well as doing some of the &amp;ldquo;calculations&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Last year I posted a blog post where we looked at a way to use elementary homotopy theory to hang a picture on the wall in a stupid way. The task was to hang a picture on two nails in such a way that if we pull one of the nails out, the picture falls down. “That is stupid” I hear you say, but premise is as premise does, or something similar quoted from Forrest Gump.</description>
