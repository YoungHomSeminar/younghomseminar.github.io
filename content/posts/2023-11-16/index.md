**Speaker:** [Itamar Mor](https://webspace.maths.qmul.ac.uk/i.a.mor/) â€“ Queen Mary University of London

**Abstract:** Using the proetale site of the Morava stabiliser group, I give a construction of the $K(n)$-local $E_n$ Adams spectral sequence as a HFPSS. A modified version gives a spectral sequence computing the Picard and Brauer groups of $K(n)$-local spectra.
