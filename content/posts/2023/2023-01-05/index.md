**Speaker:** [Sebastian Chenery](https://sebastiandchenery.wordpress.com/) - University of Southampton

**Abstract:** We will discuss recent work inspired by a paper of Jeffrey and Selick, where they ask whether the pullback bundle over a connected sum can itself be homeomorphic to a connected sum. We provide a framework to tackle this question through classical homotopy theory, before pivoting to rational homotopy theory to give an answer after taking based loop spaces.
