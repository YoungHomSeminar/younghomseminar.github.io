**Abstract:** Categories of equivariant objects (representations, equivariant spectra, equivariant Kasparov categories, etcetera) often exist globally for all finite groups, interrelated by restriction functors which restrict the group action. Frequently, there are also inductionâ€‹ functors in the other direction, which are both left and right adjoint to the restriction functors. One may see this as an equivariant analogue of the existence of biproducts in a category.

In this talk, I will describe recent joint work with Tobias Lenz and Sil Linskens in which we identify the universal (presentable) global category satisfying both stability and equivariant semiadditivity: it is a variant of the category of global spectra studied by Stefan Schwede.
