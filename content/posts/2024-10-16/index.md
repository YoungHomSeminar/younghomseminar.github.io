**Abstract:** The generalized Tate diagram developed by Greenlees and May is a fundamental tool in equivariant homotopy theory. In this talk, I will discuss an integration of the generalized Tate diagram with the equivariant slice filtration of Hill--Hopkins--Ravenel, resulting in a generalized Tate diagram for equivariant spectral sequences. This new diagram provides valuable insights into various equivariant spectral sequences and allows us to extract information about isomorphism regions between these equivariant filtrations. 

As an application, we will begin by proving a stratification theorem for the negative cone of the slice spectral sequence. Building upon the work of Meier--Shi--Zeng, we will then utilize this stratification to establish shearing isomorphisms, explore transchromatic phenomena, analyze vanishing lines within the negative cone of the slice spectral sequences associated with periodic Hill—Hopkins—Ravenel and Lubin—Tate theories. Finally, we utilize these tools to explain some duality of differentials between the positive and negative cones.

This is joint work with Yutao Liu and XiaoLin Danny Shi.
