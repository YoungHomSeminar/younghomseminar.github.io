What this actually means is that, in equivariant homotopy theory, Mackey functors appear wherever one would expect to find abelian groups, and Tambara functors appear wherever one would expect to find commutative rings. However, the theories of Mackey and Tambara functors are comparatively much less developed than those of abelian groups and commutative rings.","title":"Mackey and Tambara functors over LCC categories"},{"content":"Speaker: Torgeir Aambø – Norwegian University of Science and Technology\nAbstract: Chromatic homotopy theory views the stable homotopy category as certain nicely behaved layers glued together along formal neighborhoods.

Many important equivariant spectra admit global refinements, and these refinements have led to theoretical advances and have aided in calculations. However not only does global homotopy theory admit applications to equivariant homotopy theory, but it seems reasonable to expect that global homotopy theory is in some sense determined by equivariant homotopy theory. For example, there exists a restriction functor which sends a global spectrum to a $G$-spectrum for every compact Lie group $G$. Furthermore, these collectively form a conservative family of functors. I will present a result which explains exactly how the infinity category of global spectra is built from the infinity categories of $G$-spectra. It says that the infinity category of global spectra is a partially lax limit of a diagram indexing the infinity categories of $G$-spectra for all $G$, lax on the surjections and strict on the injections.
