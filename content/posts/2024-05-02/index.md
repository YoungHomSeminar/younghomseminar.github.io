**Speaker:** [Ben Szczesny](https://www.benszczesny.com/) – Ohio State University

**Abstract:** A classic result by Dunn establishes the additivity of the little cube operads with respect to the Boardman-Vogt tensor of operads. Unlike its $\infty$-category counterparts, the Boardman-Vogt tensor does not preserve homotopic properties, marking Dunn’s result as notably distinct. This talk aims to demystify Dunn’s additivity for graduate students and explain the speaker’s work in extending Dunn's results to various embedding operads, including equivariant and framed little disks.
