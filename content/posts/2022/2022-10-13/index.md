**Abstract:** Brauer groups and Azumaya algebras play an important role in many areas of mathematics. For instance, Antieau and Gepner showed that the Brauer group of the sphere spectrum $\mathbb{S}$ is zero, giving us the rigidity result for $\mathbb{S}$-modules. In this talk, I will walk you through Hopkins and Lurie's computation (up to a filtration) of the Brauer groups of Lubin-Tate spectra, which are important building blocks in Chromatic Homotopy Theory. 

If you attended my YTM talk, I hope you will still attend this talk since this time I will give a lot more detail.
