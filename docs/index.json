Roughly, one could think of twisted spectra as arising as sections of a bundle of categories whose fibre is the category of spectra. There are multiple ways of rigorously making sense of this: using sheaves of categories, local systems of categories, or modules over Thom spectra. While twisted spectra are essential when constructing stable Floer homotopy types, and may provide a better understanding of the homotopy theoretic underpinning of Floer theory, they are also interesting in their own right from a purely homotopy theoretic point of view, being the obvious generalisation of parametrised spectra (which would correspond to sections of a \u0026ldquo;trivial bundle”). In this talk I will give an expository talk on twisted parametrised spectra and explain how they naturally appear in Seiberg-Witten Floer theory.

Many important equivariant spectra admit global refinements, and these refinements have led to theoretical advances and have aided in calculations. However not only does global homotopy theory admit applications to equivariant homotopy theory, but it seems reasonable to expect that global homotopy theory is in some sense determined by equivariant homotopy theory. For example, there exists a restriction functor which sends a global spectrum to a $G$-spectrum for every compact Lie group $G$. Furthermore, these collectively form a conservative family of functors. I will present a result which explains exactly how the infinity category of global spectra is built from the infinity categories of $G$-spectra. It says that the infinity category of global spectra is a partially lax limit of a diagram indexing the infinity categories of $G$-spectra for all $G$, lax on the surjections and strict on the injections.
