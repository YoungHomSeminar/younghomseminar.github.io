Abstract: Global equivariant stable homotopy theory is a formalism which admits applications to orbifold cohomology, elliptic cohomology and importantly equivariant stable homotopy theory. Many important equivariant spectra admit global refinements, and these refinements have led to theoretical advances and have aided in calculations. However not only does global homotopy theory admit applications to equivariant homotopy theory, but it seems reasonable to expect that global homotopy theory is in some sense determined by equivariant homotopy theory.</description>

      <title>Localization theorem for the algebraic K-theory of stable infinity-categories</title>

      <description>Speaker: Andrea Lachmann - University of Wuppertal
Abstract: The Localisation Theorem is a classical result by Quillen, which for any localisation of rings yields a long exact sequence of K-groups. In this talk we will define the algebraic K-theory functor from stable $\infty$-categories to spaces or spectra, and produce an analogue of the localisation theorem for this setting.
I have already given a short talk on this topic at the YTM, but this time I will go a lot more into detail, so you can still learn something new even if you attended my previous talk.</description>

      <title>Dimensions of colimits</title>

      <description>Speaker: Maxime Ramzi – Unversity of Copenhagen
Abstract: We use the Hochschild-homological interpretation of dimensions and more generally traces in symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categories to produce formulas for dimensions and traces of colimits over sufficiently nice spaces.
These formulas specialize on the one hand to the very classical character-theoretic formulas for dimensions of coinvariants in the case of vector spaces in characteristic $0$ and when the space is $BG$ for some finite group $G$; and on the other hand to the Blumberg-Cohen-Schlichtkrull formula for topological Hochschild homology of Thom spectra.</description>

      <title>Polygons and TR with coefficients</title>

      <description>Speaker: Jonas McCandless - University of Münster
Abstract: I will introduce the notion of a polygonic spectrum which is a multi-object version of the notion of a cyclotomic spectrum indexed by polygons rather than the circle. This is designed to capture the structure on topological Hochschild homology of a ring with coefficients in a bimodule. Using this, I will explain the construction of TR with coefficients and explain how this is equipped with compatible Frobenius and Verschiebung maps.</description>

      <description>The goal of this online seminar is to provide a meeting space for young people in homotopy theory to share their research with people in the same area. All incoming, current and recently graduated PhD students are welcome to participate.
The talks will be held online, biweekly, on Thursdays 2pm GMT.
The talks can be either expository or research based, but should contain at least five minutes describing your own research.</description>
