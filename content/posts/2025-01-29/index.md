**Abstract:** In computer science (and mathematics), we often study various different types of "machine" or dynamical system. There are a number of different ways of fitting such things into a category - there are various notions of morphism between such systems, but also ways of treating systems as morphisms in a higher category to build composite systems.

Combining these different notions, one arrives naturally at the conclusion that there should be a pseudo triple category of systems. However, constructing such an object, or even defining the right coherences that it should satisfy, is very inconvenient to do by hand. I will explain all these things and show how a suitable homotopy-theoretic approach can solve this problem.
