**Abstract:** Mackey and Tambara functors are equivariant generalizations of abelian groups and commutative rings, respectively. What this actually means is that, in equivariant homotopy theory, Mackey functors appear wherever one would expect to find abelian groups, and Tambara functors appear wherever one would expect to find commutative rings. However, the theories of Mackey and Tambara functors are comparatively much less developed than those of abelian groups and commutative rings. In this talk, I'll introduce these algebraic gadgets and describe ongoing work to develop and apply the theories of Mackey and Tambara functors.
