The goal of this online seminar is to provide a meeting space for young people in homotopy theory to share their research with people in the same area. All incoming, current and recently graduated PhD students are welcome to participate. 

The talks will be held online, biweekly, on Thursdays 2pm GMT. 

The talks can be either expository or research based, but should contain at least five minutes describing your own research. Each talk will be roughly 50 minutes, and should have a 10 minute timeslot for questions.
