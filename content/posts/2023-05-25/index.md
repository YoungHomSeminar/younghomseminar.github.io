**Speaker:** [Andrei Konovalov](https://www.esaga.uni-due.de/andrei.konovalov/) – University of Duisburg-Essen

**Abstract:** I will discuss the problem of constructing a natural rational structure on periodic cyclic homology of dg-algebras and dg-categories. The promising candidate is A. Blanc’s topological K-theory. I will show that it, indeed, provides a rational structure in a number of cases and I will discuss its structural properties and possible applications.
