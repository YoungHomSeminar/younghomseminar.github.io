**Abstract:** In recent years work by Calmés-Dotto-Harpaz-Hebestreit-Land-Moi-Nardin-Nikolaus-Steimle have moved the theory of Hermitian K-theory into the framework of stable $\infty$-categories. I will introduce the basic ideas and notions of this new theory and introduce a tool which can help us understand this better: Real Topological Hochschild Homology. I will then explain the ingredients that goes into constructing the geometric fixed points of this THR as a functor, generalising the formula for ring spectra with anti-involution of Dotto-Moi-Patchkoria-Reeh.
