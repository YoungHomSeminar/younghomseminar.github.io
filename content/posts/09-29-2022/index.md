**Speaker:** [Andrea Lachmann](https://www2.math.uni-wuppertal.de/~lachmann/) - University of Wuppertal

**Abstract:** The Localisation Theorem is a classical result by Quillen, which for any localisation of rings yields a long exact sequence of K-groups. In this talk we will define the algebraic K-theory functor from stable $\infty$-categories to spaces or spectra, and produce an analogue of the localisation theorem for this setting.

I have already given a short talk on this topic at the YTM, but this time I will go a lot more into detail, so you can still learn something new even if you attended my previous talk.
