**Abstract:** The goal of this talk is to introduce enriched versions of Segal categories, and in particular, Segal dg-categories. I will start by reviewing the classical notion of Segal category and then I will introduce templicial objects following Lowen-Mertens as replacements for simplicial objects in a non-cartesian context, allowing me to arrive at the definition of Segal dg-category. After this, I will outline a strategy to obtain an adequate model structure for these objects, taking this chance to overview the category of Necklaces, and finally I will show the results we have so far been able to prove.
