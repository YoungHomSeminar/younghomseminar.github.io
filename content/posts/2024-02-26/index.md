**Abstract:** The topological Hochschild homology of a ring (or ring spectrum) $R$ is an $S^1$-spectrum, $THH(R).$ Along with its $C_n \subset S^1$-fixed points, $THH(R)$ has been widely studied due to numerous applications in algebraic $K$-theory computations. When studying the fixed points of topological Hochschild homology, Hesselholt and Madsen found a close relationship with Witt vectors. Building on this, they defined the notion of a Witt complex, and showed that it captures the algebraic structure of the homotopy groups of the fixed points of $THH$. Recently, a theory of twisted topological Hochschild homology for equivariant rings (or ring spectra) was defined by Blumberg, Gerhardt, Hill, and Lawson; building off of Hill, Hopkins, and Ravenel's work on equivariant norms. In this talk, we will describe the algebraic structure of the equivariant homotopy groups of twisted $THH$. In particular, building off of Blumberg, Gerhadt, Hill, and Lawson's definition of equivariant Witt vectors, we will define an equivariant Witt complex, and prove that the equivariant homotopy of twisted $THH$ has this structure. This is joint work with Anna Marie Bohmann, Teena Gerhardt, Cameron Krulewski, and Lucy Yang.
